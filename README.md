# Breast-Cancer-classification
In this project I have made a Breast Cancer Classification system using Machine learning. The dataset used in this project is taken from sklearn library, the dataset can be also downloaded from kaggle. Logistic Regression Model is used to Classify whether the Breast Cancer is Malignant or Benign.
 This trained model has a Accuracy of 95% on training data  and 92% on test data.
